A Few Important Notes
*************************

Navigation:
	We recommend that you use the WordPress 3.0 custom menu system, but if you choose not 
	to, our default menu system will be in place. To use our default menu system, go to 
	My Theme --> Settings and select the pages that you would like to appear in the top
	level navigation. Keep in mind that when you add a new page, it will not be shown by
	default.
	
Page Comments:
	Traditionally, Pages that have comments do not show the date like Posts do. This is 
	because pages are "timeless." While we understand this, for this theme, we chose to
	show a date stamp on comments in pages.
